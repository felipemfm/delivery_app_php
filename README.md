# PONPON - drone delivery application

A futuristic personal drone delivery application developed using PHP and Google Maps API.

## General info

Developed as a graduation project for the Technical School HAL Tokyo in Japan.

The theme was to create a "brand of the future" and our group came out with the idea of a personal delivery drone, capable of both picking up orders at stores and making a delivery at people's houses, in a world wide range.

To be able to pinpoint locations all around the world, the system makes use of Google Maps and Google Geocoding API.

This project was placed in 5th place at the [2022 HAL Tokyo Graduation Production Exhibition](https://miraisozoten.com/hal_tokyo/works/201/) winning an award from Japan's Fuji Television.
